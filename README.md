This is a pet project that uses:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) via [re-base](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/re-base)

Most of the application is behind a login, but you are welcome to check the code :smile:
